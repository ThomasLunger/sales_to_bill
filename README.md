# sales_to_bill
This is some code I developed for my employer for internal use, 
The objective was to transfer completed data from a sales sheet to a bill trigger sheet.
I started by matching the PO numbers between the two sheets to find the cooresponding rows, Then created a function to add 5 days to account for shipping delays, then wrote the data transfer logic to copy relevant Tracking numbers and Serial Numbers, Finally I decided to color the generated rows green which were processed without any faults.
This project is free to use/modify and I hope it helps clear up any excel file automation problems you may encounter!
